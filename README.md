# Dungeon Crawler
Small ASCII Based Dungeon Crawler Game

A simple ASCII C++ game

I have included the legend for the game inside the code to make it easier for readablility. Additionally, the desired skills practiced inside the code are illustrated through:

Reading an external file.
Parsing the data from the file, which contains the length and width as well as map layout.
Controlling the movement of the ASCII characters by utilizing 2D-Arrays to emulate a cartesian graph coordinate system.
Monitoring player score and health.
Switching between files programmatically rather through user input.
